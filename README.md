This is a Next.js project that is currently in development for a local roofing contractor. The project utilizes Tailwind for styling and will eventually feature a simple backend framework in order to connect with the client's CRM.

See the Site Live [HERE](https://ridge-pros-construction.vercel.app/).

Update:
  1. Initialized the project utilizing NextJs and Tailwind.
  2. Created page layout.
  3. Styled the project according to client's branding.

Next Steps in development include:
  1. Complete home / landing page UI.
  2. Add content to periphreal pages.
  3. Further enhance page responsiveness.
  4. Integrate Hubspot API in order to allow the client to capture and manage leads to a centralized Hubspot account.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
